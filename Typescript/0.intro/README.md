#   How to install Typescript using node module
**Steps**
- Install node on the machine
- initialise with the command in the directory of interest for a base file
    -   npm init -y
- Install typescript using the command
    -   npm i typescript
- There is the need to have compiler for the make typescript executable with the command, it will create a config.json file
    -   npx tsc -init 
-   On the tsconfig.json uncomment the OutDir in line 58 which is where your compiled code will be written. Create a directory build on the line OutDir.
    -    "outDir": "./build",                /* Specify an output folder for all emitted files. */
    -   **Note:** The directory can be any name
-   Create a directory 'build' in the current parent directory
-   Create a file with a ts extension
    -   index.ts(sample file)
- On the package.json, add the code below to the scripts under the tests key 
  -  "start": "node app.ts"
- Finally compile the code to JavaScript with the command
  - npx tsc
- It creates the js version of the ts version of the file
- run the command of the file with node then the file
  - node index.js
- It look more tedious to run the js file. You can modify the package.json file and modify with the comand below
  - "start": "node build/app.js"
- Use npm start to run`
